# Omni-Dev Agent

A modular, intelligent development assistant capable of planning, coding, testing, and documenting software projects.

## Architecture

The Omni-Dev Agent follows a modular architecture with the following core components:

- **Orchestration Layer**: The brain that manages workflows and coordinates between components
- **Document Planning Component**: Generates structured plans for development tasks
- **Terminal Execution Component**: Safely executes command-line operations
- **Code Development Component**: Writes, modifies, and debugs code
- **Browser Testing Component**: Automates web testing and validation
- **Documentation Generation Component**: Creates comprehensive documentation

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the agent: `python -m src.main`
3. See examples in the `examples/` directory

## Development

- Follow the modular design principles
- Each component should be self-contained and testable
- Use the provided interfaces for component communication
- Maintain comprehensive logging and error handling
