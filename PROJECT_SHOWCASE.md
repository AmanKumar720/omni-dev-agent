# Omni-Dev Agent - Project Showcase

## Overview
The Omni-Dev Agent is a modular, intelligent development assistant capable of planning, coding, testing, and documenting software projects automatically.

## Key Features

### ðŸ§  Intelligent Planning
- **Automatic Task Type Detection**: Identifies web development, API development, or general development tasks
- **Smart Effort Estimation**: Calculates hours and days based on task complexity
- **Detailed Phase Breakdown**: Structures projects into manageable phases with clear dependencies

### ðŸ“‹ Comprehensive Templates
- **Web Development**: Full-stack development with frontend, backend, integration, and documentation phases
- **API Development**: Focused on API design, implementation, testing, and documentation
- **General Development**: Flexible template for any software development project

### ðŸ“Š Project Estimation
- **Hour-based Estimation**: Provides realistic time estimates for each phase
- **Complexity Analysis**: Adjusts estimates based on keywords like "complex", "enterprise", "authentication"
- **Dependency Management**: Tracks phase dependencies for proper project scheduling

## Sample Output

### Input Task
```
"Develop a web feedback form feature with backend API and frontend interface"
```

### Generated Plan
- **Task Type**: web_development
- **Total Estimated Hours**: 80
- **Total Estimated Days**: 10.0
- **Phases**: 4 (Backend, Frontend, Integration & Testing, Documentation)

### Detailed Breakdown
1. **Backend Development** (32 hours) - High effort
   - Design API endpoints and data models
   - Set up database schema and migrations
   - Implement API routes and business logic
   - Add authentication and authorization
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for API
   - Set up API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

2. **Frontend Development** (16 hours) - Medium effort
   - Create wireframes and UI mockups
   - Set up frontend project structure
   - Implement core UI components
   - Add form validation and error handling
   - Implement responsive design
   - Write frontend unit and integration tests

3. **Integration & Testing** (16 hours) - Medium effort
   - Connect frontend to backend APIs
   - Implement error handling and loading states
   - End-to-end testing with real data
   - Performance testing and optimization
   - Cross-browser compatibility testing

4. **Documentation** (16 hours) - Medium effort
   - Document API endpoints with examples
   - Create user guides and tutorials
   - Write technical specifications
   - Create deployment and maintenance guides

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.13.5
- **Framework**: Modular component architecture
- **Dependencies**: Flask, SQLAlchemy, Selenium, Sphinx, Rich, and more
- **Development**: Virtual environment, Git version control

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/omni-dev-agent.git
cd omni-dev-agent
```

2. **Set up virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\setup_env.ps1  # For Windows PowerShell
# or
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the agent**
```bash
python -m src.main
```

## Usage Examples

```python
from src.components.document_planner import DocumentPlanner

planner = DocumentPlanner()

# Generate a plan
task = "Build a REST API for user management"
plan = planner.generate_plan(task)

# Save as Markdown
planner.save_plan(plan, "my_project_plan.md")

# Get formatted output
markdown_plan = planner.format_plan_as_markdown(plan)
print(markdown_plan)
```
